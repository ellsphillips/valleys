# valleys

## Motivation

The `valleys` theme is an extension of VS Code's default `Dark+` colour theme and crafted by an experienced software developer, particularly in Python.

`valleys` exploits VS Code's ability to effectively render syntax highlighting with hand-picked colours and styling rules to better the object-oriented programming experience.

## Installation

- Open the "**Extensions**" sidebar in VS Code
- Search for `valleys`
- Select "**valleys**" by ellsphillips and click "**Install**"
- [Select the Theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme)
