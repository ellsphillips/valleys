# valleys

## Motivation

The [valleys](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ellsphillips.valleys) theme is an extension of VS Code's default `Dark+` colour theme, crafted by an software developer with particular experience in Python.

`valleys` exploits VS Code's ability to effectively render syntax highlighting with hand-picked colours and styling rules to better the object-oriented programming experience.
